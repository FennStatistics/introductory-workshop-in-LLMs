# Workshop Preparation Checklist

To get the most out of our workshop on Large Language Models, please complete the following preparation steps.

---

## 1. ðŸ“– Read in Advance

ðŸ“¢ **Important Note:** This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a short, three-hour timeframe. To gain deeper insights, I highly recommend reviewing the **Additional Resources** section prior to the workshop and to read some of the introductory literature. Further, if you want to follow the code demonstrations, itâ€™s crucial to come with a **basic understanding of Python**, which, however is not necessary to follow all the code demonstrations on a conceptual level.

> During the session, weâ€™ll focus on hands-on learning, showcasing practical and impactful applications of LLMs. I look forward to exploring these use cases with you!

## 2. ðŸ”§ Software Setup (If Desired)

To follow along with code demonstrations during the workshop, consider installing the following software:

- **Python**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Essential Packages:
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - Additional packages required for specific code demonstrations (see code within folders "1_fundamentals" to "6_appendix")

  - Alternative: if you prefer to avoid installing Python on your machine, consider using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup and provides access to computing resources.

- **Anaconda**: [Download here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

- **R and Quarto**:
  - **R**: [Download here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
    - Essential Libraries:
      - Libraries needed for specific code demonstrations (see code within folders "1_fundamentals" to "6_appendix")
      - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Recommended Extensions:
    - [Python Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
    - [Jupyter Notebook Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
    - [R Programming Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r)
    - [Quarto Publishing System](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)

  - **Additional Recommended Extensions for VS Code**:
    - [GitHub Copilot (AI pair programmer, subscription required)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
    - For collaboration using GitHub (see the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)):
      - [Using Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)
      - [GitLens for enhanced Git capabilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)


### 2.1 ðŸ”§ Software Setup for "agentic" Retrieval Augmented Generation

> This code enables you to automatically scan any amout of (scientific) PDFs. I will highly likely form a working group on this topic with the aim of a joint publication. 

You are also invited to download all the necessary software for this code demonstration, however it requieres some understanding of web development.
