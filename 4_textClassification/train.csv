"I'm going to a conference right now, but I just have one class left. I'm really happy because NAME is coming today, and I'm really excited to see him. I have to do the grocery shopping and get all these things done before he comes. Yeah.";"1"
"Okay, so at 12 I was petting a dog very briefly, and then rushed back here so I could sleep. My hair feels soft, it didn't take too long. It would have helped if I cooked food, and I can drag those back when I get back to read for psychology. Okay.";"1"
"Okay, so right now I wrote the stupidest fucking thing for my math class and I wrote down the wrong stuff and I haven't even started my homework, and I'm basically going to fail the fucking class because I'm stupid. I'm a piece of shit.";"0"
"I'm currently in my car. I just dropped my boyfriend off at the bus station so he could go back home. I'm going to see him on Thursday next week, but I'm really upset and have to study for a test, so that doesn't help. But that's my situation.";"1"

"I'm eating right now. I'm in the cafeteria of my dorm before my psychology class. Yeah, I just had a crab cake. I don't know how I feel about them. Just recording this, not really feeling down or anything, just talking. So, NAME and NAME, put your pants on. How much does England?";"0"

"I am currently very annoyed. Came early so I could go to office hours for my course. And I got stuck, having to drive all the way up to the top of the roof level of my garage because I never come at this time. So, I never noticed it's always full.";"0"
"I was just at the pre-Halloween social. I actually met some new people. That's nice. I said I wasn't going to eat anything, but I did. So yeah, I'm on my way back to my dorm. I'm probably going to take notes, do my homework, and then go to sleep.";"0"
"So now I'm just watching a movie for my essay that's about to be a thousand words and is due on Sunday. So yeah, I'm just very tired from watching, but it's really interesting. I hope I finish it so I can just relax.";"0"

"I am back at my dorm after I just went to a meeting for one of my clubs. I have to go do some work and then I can go to sleep. Overall, I felt pretty okay. Today, I dressed up a little bit, but overall, it was pretty, pretty okay.";"0"
"I'm reading the psych readings and preparing for the test. I finished an exam 30 minutes ago. I guess I've spoken to my brother and parents on Facebook. I'm pretty happy that I get to see NAME, and I'm recreating test readings. Obviously.";"1"
"I'm done with class for today. I know she got out of my lab like an hour and a half, or an hour and 15 minutes, early. So I'm really happy about that. Going to the meeting now, and then I get to go home.";"1"
"I kind of had a mental breakdown, crying. I feel like nothing I'm doing is working on this triangle. I'm really trying hard. The psychology class is stressing me out a little bit, along with chemistry. So I'm just praying that I can do this and do better.";"0"
"Right now I am in my dorm room and doing homework. And also watching Netflix. I am currently excited. A little bit because of some sort of events today and a tiny bit stressed because of my homework, but overall, I would say that I am content with everything right now.";"1"
"Studying for genetics right now. My first study session, I didn't know their psychology. I'm doing my homework for genetics and I have time to spend with NAME later on. I really don't want to think about it, it makes me a little sad that I have to do all the raw because I don't like it.";"1"
"I'm in my dorm preparing for my psychology class, which is going to start in 15 minutes. I'm re-reading the notes and snacking at the same time. I'm tired, like always. I'm excited for the dinner tonight because it's going to be a Harry Potter-themed special dinner.";"0"

"Right now, I'm sitting on the couch looking out a door. I'm currently smoking weed and I feel like I want to laugh. I'm quite happy right now. I'm taking a break from studying, but I'll get back on that grind soon. I'm not feeling sad, I'm feeling happy.";"1"
"If it makes you unhappy, don't like him until he likes you. I just said, "We'll see." Only time will tell. I was just pensive, I was looking off into the distance, thinking about stuff. If you have it all planned out.";"1"
"Hey, what's up, you guys? It's me again, just chilling with my homies NAME in their room. NAME, I'll talk to you. All right, you know it's got a NAME, and we're studying chemistry. We're supposed to be in the room.";"0"
"I just took my test. I woke up this morning and wasn't feeling well. Excuse this morning. So yeah, that's been going on today. I felt horrible about the test. So, we'll see later how I did. I'm just feeling stressed now.";"0"
"I'm trying to do my homework, studying, trying to study. I'm just kind of like, sometimes I just get nervous. Can you try to concentrate? Listening to music, but I just had to sit out the past. I feel very uneasy like this. Add a study room in my dorm area.";"0"

"Sitting in my dorm playing Fortnite. Overall, I'm content, not as stressed as I was yesterday because I got some stuff done. I'm still pretty stressed because I got a test next week. I think they are both in one day. Make some work stuff to do, but yeah, just trying to relax a little bit.";"1"
"All right, right now I am finishing up a learning exercise for my chemistry class. Honestly, I'm probably just going to go to sleep right now. We'll probably just get ready for bed and wake up early tomorrow. I'm feeling good, just quiet right now. So I've been alone, but I feel fine.";"0"
"Right now, I'm heading upstairs for a test. Do you need another NAME to go to my meeting with NAME? I'm really nervous. I got done studying for my psychology. I'm not done yet. It's going to be a long day. I'm really stressed. God hears my surroundings.";"0"
"I'm in bed right now. I'm really tired. I don't feel good. I really should go to my 3, but I also really don't want to because I said "We'll see you right now". I understand that resting. That's literally all that's happening right now.";"0"
"Currently sitting in my dorm, reading my psych reading before class. Just got back from PLACE, eating with some friends. I haven't seen you in a while, so it was fun. Content, though stressed a little bit for the things coming up next few weeks.";"1"

At this point, I fight through it and hope for the best. Behind studying and everything. I finished my complaining.";"0"
"Yeah, so I'm just hanging out here at the NAME house. I'm feeling extra happy and not really stressed out. I'm just hanging out with my friends, and I'm really content with my life right now, and I'm just out here, really having a good time trying to live, you know.";"1"
"PLACE practice just ended, heading home, going to have dinner and maybe get some couple of things done, class requests and then, super, hey.. I'm having a kind of day today. So yeah, power through everything I needed to do. A little bit sore, but I'm working on it.";"1"
